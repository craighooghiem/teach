### StudentEvals

Student evals is a platform that allows teachers to evaluate students based on a number of metrics.
Each student has a record with a unique identifier (in most cases, a student number). 
Each class can have multiple students and each student can have multiple programs.
Each evaluation has a specific set of evaluation data sets (defined by the user).

## Evaluations

Each evaluation is a new record for that class and that student.
Each class or student can have these records exported as a group in order to view.
Exported evaluations may also contain summaries, just like the dashboard does, about the student's performance and other metrics.
